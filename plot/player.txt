The player is Morrigan's envoy.  Since they have to explore different
timelines, they acquire knowledge they couldn't otherwise possess (much like
in "stories: The path of destinies").  This is due to (future) Morrigan trying
to prevent the Calamity. She can't go back herself, as there cannot be two
Ancients with the same affinity, so she sends the player instead. This broke
time even further (which is why Morrigan isn't willing to do it again),
creating a singularity of timelines, of which the player character can access
only a limited few. They can meet an alternative version of themselves though
(PVP), and blablabla (PVP, Co-op content).
