Name: TBD
Summary:
   Group of brigands that actually ended up forming a legitimate business after
   accumulating sufficient wealth. They do not actually perform the contracts
   themselves, and instead use they numerous contacts with active brigand
   groups to bribe them into either targeting or ignoring travelers and
   merchants. Joining the group requires a substantial financial donation, and
   is considered the best possible form of retirement by many bandits.
